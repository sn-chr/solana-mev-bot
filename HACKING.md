Contributing to OSRFramework
============================

Reporting issues, bugs and fresh ideas
--------------------------------------

The way in which we track the issues regarding the software is by means of the issues page in Github's project site, which can be found here: <https://github.com/i3visio/osrframework/issues>.
Whether you have experimented problems with the installation, you have found a bug in a new platform or you feel that we can add a new functionality, you can find the place to report them there. The only "rule" is to notify one error per issue to be able to track the problems indepently, as well as trying to provide as much information as possible regarding the OS or version you are trying.

If you find that a transform in Maltego is not behaving as expected, we recommend you to set the debug mode as True. Go to Manage --> Manage Transforms, choose the transform and mark the "Set debug info" as True. Please, copy the information shown in the new tab in the issue so as to provide more information to debug it faster.

Contributing code
-----------------

Whether you want to add a new wrapper or fix a bug, the basic instructions to contribute and perform a pull request on Github are the following (we assume that you have installed Git by yourself, so please follow the instructions in the project's website to install it on your system <https://git-scm.com/downloads>). We will assume that the username for this test is `osrframework_contributor`.

First of all, logged in Github and fork the repository by pressing the corresponding button in <https://github.com/i3visio/osrframework>. This will create a copy of the repository under your profile (i. e.: `https://github.com/osrframework_contributor/osrframework`).

You can clone your forked repository now:
```
# This is an example! Change "osrframework_contributor" for your nick!
git clone https://github.com/osrframework_contributor/osrframework
cd osrframework
```

Then, you can modify any file you want, for example, the `README.md`.
```
# Opening it with nano... 
nano README.md
```

After the apprpriate changes have been performed, you can test the installation with pip.
```
pip install -e ./
```

Whenever you want, you can add the changes performed to the Git index to keep track of what you have changed and prepar it for the commit. 
```
# Add one file
git add ./README.md
# Or adding all the files modified... Just be a lil' bit more careful
# git add -A
```

Once you are happy with the changes (and you have tested them!), you can commit the changes with a descriptive message.
```
git commit -m "Fixing issue #0: modifications in the README.md file."
```

You have to push the changes to your Github project.
```
git push origin
```

You're almost there. You can now go to your project's website (`http://github.com/osrframework_contributor/osrframework`) and click in the `Pulls` tab or going directly to it by appending `pulls` to your forked URL, something similar to `https://github.com/osrframework_contributor/osrframework/pulls`. Then provide there as much detail as you can about the contents of the pull request and shortly we will evaluate the changes and pushed it upstream.

Extending OSRFramework
----------------------

This section will provide information about how to extend the different tools found in the framework.

### Creating new usufy.py wrappers or modifying old ones

The basic things you should know in order to create a new wrapper are:
* The structure of the URL that links to the profile.
* The part of the HTML code that says that the user does NOT exist.
* A valid nickname that has an active profile in the website.

For the example, we are goind to use an invented socialnetwork: `http://example.com/james` is the URL of a user called `james` in that figured platform. The error returned is `<title>404 not found</title>`. 

Knowing that, you can go to the `wrappers` folder and copy (we are lazy, right?) another wrapper that works to a new file. 
```
# Assuming you are in the <PROJECT_HOME>
cd osrframework
cd wrappers
cp adtriboo.py example.py
```

First, we'll change the name of the wrapper and the tags:
```
class Example(Platform):
    """ 
        A <Platform> object for Example.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        """ 
            Constructor... 
        """
        self.platformName = "Example"
        self.tags = ["test"]
```

We'll tell the framework, that this platform has usufy-style profile pages by setting to True the corresponding variable:
```
        ########################
        # Defining valid modes #
        ########################
        self.isValidMode = {}        
        self.isValidMode["phonefy"] = False
        self.isValidMode["usufy"] = True
        self.isValidMode["searchfy"] = False   
```

We will provide the URL patern:
```
        ######################################
        # Search URL for the different modes #
        ######################################
        # Strings with the URL for each and every mode
        self.url = {}        
        #self.url["phonefy"] = "http://anyurl.com//phone/" + "<phonefy>"
        self.url["usufy"] = "https://example.com/" + "<usufy>"       
        #self.url["searchfy"] = "http://anyurl.com/search/" + "<searchfy>"  
```

We will know tell if the platform needs credentials to work:
```
        ######################################
        # Whether the user needs credentials #
        ######################################
        self.needsCredentials = {}        
        #self.needsCredentials["phonefy"] = False
        self.needsCredentials["usufy"] = False
        #self.needsCredentials["searchfy"] = False 
```

In some platforms, we may now that the usernames always match a given regular expression (for instance, Twitter does not allow '.' in a username). If this is the case, we can modify the `validQuery` attribute:
```
        #################
        # Valid queries #
        #################
        # Strings that will imply that the query number is not appearing
        self.validQuery = {}
        # The regular expression '.+' will match any non-empty query.
        #self.validQuery["phonefy"] = re.compile(".+")
        self.validQuery["usufy"] = re.compile(".+")   
        #self.validQuery["searchfy"] = re.compile(".+")
```

The last part, is telling the framework which is the message that appears when the user is not present. This is an array, so more than one message can be used here.
```
        ###################
        # Not_found clues #
        ###################
        # Strings that will imply that the query number is not appearing
        self.notFoundText = {}
        #self.notFoundText["phonefy"] = []
        self.notFoundText["usufy"] = ["<title>404 not found</title>"]
        #self.notFoundText["searchfy"] = []  
```

And that's almost all. Afterwards, you will have to edit the platform_selection.py file, which can be found in the utils folder.

```
# Once in the <PROJECT_HOME>
cd osrframework
cd utils
nano platform_selection.py
```

Once here, you will have to do just *2* more changes. Firstly, adding an import to the recently created file. NOTE: the name of the .py you created (in lower letters) should be appended to `osrframework.wrappers.` and the name of the class should be with a capitalised `E` matching the name of the class inside that file. Please! Respect the alphabetical order just to be able to find wrappers easily!
```
# E
from osrframework.wrappers.ebay import Ebay
from osrframework.wrappers.echatta import Echatta
from osrframework.wrappers.elmundo import Elmundo
from osrframework.wrappers.enfemenino import Enfemenino
from osrframework.wrappers.ethereum import Ethereum
from osrframework.wrappers.etsy import Etsy
from osrframework.wrappers.evilzone import Evilzone
from osrframework.wrappers.example import Example
```

Secondly, adding the class you have created in the example.py file to the list of platforms.
```
    # E
    listAll.append(Ebay())
    listAll.append(Echatta())
    listAll.append(Elmundo())
    listAll.append(Enfemenino())
    listAll.append(Ethereum())
    listAll.append(Etsy())
    listAll.append(Evilzone())
    # Here would be the new wrapper
    listAll.append(Example())    
```


You can now try your modified version:
```
# Once in the <PROJECT_HOME>
# In Linux and MacOS:
sudo pip install -e .
# In Windows:
pip install -e .
```

Style guide
-----------

Just a few things to be taken into account:
* Use four spaces '    ' instead of a tab for identing blocks.
* Provide useful and not trivial comments in English to the code you write.
* Classes should start with a capitalised initial letter.
* As a convention, wrappers inside the `platform_selection.py` should be in alphabetical order. Anyone wants to find things easily!

Licensing
---------

The only thing we expect from other authors'code is to use a GPL-compatible license for their code, preferably GPLv3+ itself. We hope that anybody can use this tool for free (as in Free Software Foundation's four freedoms, not as in *free beer*), so help us to do it.
